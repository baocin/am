## Core Architecture

### Simplified Design Philosophy

Loom v2 has evolved from a complex distributed system to a simplified architecture that maximizes reliability while minimizing operational overhead:

```
Data Sources → Ingestion API → TimescaleDB → Processing Services → Insights
                                     ↓
                              (LISTEN/NOTIFY)
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB as Universal Backend**
   - Handles both message queuing and data persistence
   - Time-series optimization with automatic compression
   - ACID guarantees for all operations
   - Built-in LISTEN/NOTIFY for real-time updates

2. **Microservice Processing Pattern**
   - Each AI model runs in its own container
   - Services poll database tables for new data
   - REST APIs on each service for testing
   - Horizontal scaling per service type

3. **Schema-Driven Validation**
   - JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 for all data types
   - Centralized schema registry
   - Version management for schema evolution
   - Runtime validation with caching

4. **Best-of-Breed AI Models**
   - Specialized models for each task rather than one "super model"
   - GPU/CPU flexible deployment
   - Structured output using `dottxt-ai/outlines` library
   - Independent scaling and failure isolation

>
> By the way, you mentioned wanting to call your mom last week—today would be perfect since you're both free this evening. 
>
> Your stress levels have been slightly elevated this week, likely from the project deadline. I've noticed you feel better after evening walks, so I've kept your 6 PM slot free.
>
> Oh, and remember that book Sarah recommended when you had coffee last month? I noticed you'll be near the bookstore today if you want to pick it up."
