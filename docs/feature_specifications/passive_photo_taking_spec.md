# Smart Life-Logging Camera System - Technical Brief

## Core Concept
Build an automated visual documentation system that intelligently captures full-resolution photos only when the device detects "new visual content" - creating a passive "where have I been" log with minimal battery impact.

## Technical Architecture

### Two-Stage Detection Pipeline
**Stage 1: IMU Motion Trigger (Continuous, Ultra Low Power)**
- Monitor gyroscope/accelerometer via hardware interrupts  
- Power consumption: ~0.1-0.5mW continuous
- Trigger thresholds: >15° rotation or significant translation
- Wake system only when meaningful movement detected

**Stage 2: Visual Novelty Verification (On-Demand)**
- Capture 240x240 grayscale verification frame (50mW × 100ms)
- Compare with last stored frame using:
  - Feature matching (ORB)
  - Histogram correlation
  - SSIM similarity index
- If <60% similarity → trigger full capture

**Stage 3: Full Capture & Queue (Triggered)**
- Capture full-resolution image (500mW × 500ms)  
- Store with metadata: timestamp, GPS, IMU orientation, novelty score
- Queue for off-device processing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Detection System

- [ ] Multi-resolution capture system (240x240 → full res)
- [ ] On-device keyframe selection
- [ ] Metadata packaging and storage
- [ ] Basic image stitching capability

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Off-device YOLO object detection
- [ ] Face detection/recognition pipeline
- [ ] License plate recognition
- [ ] Speed estimation from visual odometry
- [ ] Spherical reconstruction and visualization

## Power & Performance Targets

**Continuous Operation:**
- Baseline monitoring: <1mW total
- Trigger events: ~5-10 per hour during active use
- Battery life: 2-3 days continuous operation

**Processing Performance:**
- IMU response: <1ms latency
- Visual verification: <100ms
- Full capture decision: <200ms total

## Key Technical Decisions

**Resolution Strategy:** 320x240 grayscale for SLAM/tracking, full resolution for archival
**Power Optimization:** Hardware IMU interrupts + selective camera wake
**Novelty Detection:** Lightweight computer vision (no deep learning on-device)
**Data Pipeline:** Local capture + cloud processing for heavy tasks

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Smart triggering system** that captures ~50-100 photos/day instead of continuous video
2. **Visual journey reconstruction** showing "where you've been" with automatic stitching  
3. **Multi-task CV pipeline** for faces, objects, speed estimation (off-device)
4. **Ultra-low power operation** enabling multi-day battery life

## Risk Mitigation

- **False triggers:** Implement learning thresholds and user feedback
- **Power management:** Aggressive sleep states and interrupt-driven architecture  
- **Storage efficiency:** Smart keyframe selection and cloud offloading
- **Privacy:** On-device processing for sensitive detection, opt-in cloud features

**Timeline Estimate:** 3-4 months for full implementation across all phases.
